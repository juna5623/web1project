                    My Hobbies
                </h2>
                <p>No doubt, hobbies have many mental and emotional benefits as well. My main hobby is learning a new language. It opens up a world of new opportunities for your and when you travel. It gives you a greater global understanding of the world we live in, and a sense of achievement and accomplishment.
                Just having hobbies but not fulfilling them is not worth. Thus to fulfill my hobbies I manage time to travel, make new friends and learn new things.</p>
